                            <p>Zest was a group project that I developed alongside 13 other people. 
                                We made a recipe manager app that pulled recipes from the Spoonacular API.
                                These recipes included ingredients, steps, and any dietary restrictions. 
                                Users were also able to create their own recipes, which allowed them to put their own twists to these input fields.

                        </div>

                            <p>
                                To dive deeper into current-day practices, we developed our site under a CRUD model. 
                                Therefore, creating, reading, updating/editing, deleting recipes were important features of our app.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div id="zest-6" class="info">
                            <p>
                                We had features that made the site more accesible to others. 
                                For one, there was text-to-speech that would activate when pressing the TTS button or any of the steps. 
                                There was also a unit conversion built into our app.
