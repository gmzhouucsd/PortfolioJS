                            <p>Zest was a group project that I developed alongside thirteen other people. 
                                We made a recipe manager app that pulled recipes from the Spoonacular API.
                                These recipes included ingredients, steps, and any dietary restrictions. 
                                Users were also able to create their own recipes, which allowed them to change up these fields and add an image to their recipe.

                                To dive deeper into current-day practices, we developed our site under a CRUD model. 
                                Therefore, creating, reading, updating/editing, and deleting recipes were important features of our app.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                We had features that made the site more accesible to others. 
                                For one, there was text-to-speech that would activate when pressing the TTS button or any of the steps. 
                                There was also a unit conversion built into our app for people that come from different countries.

                            <p>Auto Jober was a group project I did with three other people that focused on creating an app that automated applying to LinkedIn jobs.
                                We worked together to compete against 20 other teams under IEEE. 
                                It was one of my first times working with python and in a competitive programming environment, but we were still able to create a decent product in the time alloted.

                            <p>Running the program creates a GUI prompt that asks for your LinkedIn profile credentials. 
                                This helps the program log into LinkedIn and start scraping for "Easy Apply" jobs.
                                The rest of the prompted fields are then used to fill in the required information for these jobs.

                            <p>This would be an example of how the input fields on LinkedIn would look like after running the program. 
                                In this example, the email and number is automatically filed out, and other fields like the resume would also fill out. 
                                Unfortunately, unique fields like years of experience would have to be filled out manually.
