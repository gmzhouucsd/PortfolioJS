                <p><strong style="color:#3A5950">Hello! I'm Gavin, a recent UCSD Computer Science graduate.</strong> 
                    As a first-generation college student, I've always struggled to find a path that will help guide me through my professional career. 
                    Through computer science, I want to create a path that will inspire my relatives and future generations. 
                    To pave this road, I want to be a software engineer that creates a product that positvely changes the world.

                            <p>Zest was a web app that I developed alongside thirteen other people. 
                                This was my first experience programming in a group, so I learned many lessons like the importance of project management, code pipelining, and soft skills. 
                                It was also my first look at creating a product that would be used by others. 
                                This project opened my eyes to the power of programming and how it can affect the world.

                                Due to the fact that it was my first time with backend development, I was initially shocked by how much information API's had. 
                                It was a great experience being able to play with an ocean of info, which is shown in this image, and deciding what should be included on the website. 
                                This is the moment I realized I wanted to become a Full Stack Developer. 
                                Front-end devopment was always fun since HTML and CSS are so malleable, and back-end development has the power to create innovative products.

                                Our group wanted to ensure that our site was accessible and responsive. 
                                This was an eye-opening experience because I've always worked in my own environment without thinking about the abilities and devices of others. 
                                It was amazing to know that technology has upgraded to the point where programming can provide anyone with any device to interact with our creations.

                            <p>Running the program creates a GUI prompt that asks for your LinkedIn profile credentials. 
                                This helps the program log into LinkedIn and start scraping for "Easy Apply" jobs.
                                The rest of the prompted fields are then used to fill in the required information for these jobs.

                            <p>This would be an example of how the input fields on LinkedIn would look like after running the program. 
                                In this example, the email and number is automatically filed out, and other fields like the resume would also fill out. 
                                Unfortunately, unique fields like years of experience would have to be filled out manually.
